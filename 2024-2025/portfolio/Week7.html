<h1> Programming Vocabulary </h1>

<h2> Pattern Recognition </h2>
<p> Pattern Recognition is a process of finding repeating designs for example if 2 things are the same it is a pattern </p>

<h2> Mathematic Operators </h2>
<p> A symbol that stands for carrying out one or more Mathematic Operators on some data. </p>

<h2> Loops </h2>
<p> In computer programming, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. </p>

<h2> Conditional Statements </h2>
<p> A Conditional Statement begins with "if" statements to determine in an action should be taken. </p>

<h2> Algorithmic Thinking </h2>
<p> Algorithmic Thinking is a method of breaking down complex problems into smaller steps for computer or for human </p>

<h2> Relational Operators </h2>
<p> A relational operator is a programming language construct or operator that tests or defines some kind of relation between two entities. </p>

<h2> Variables </h2>
<p> Data is stored in a variable. Each variable has a name. </p>

<h2> Decomposition </h2>
<p> Decomposition means to separate into constituent parts or elements or into simpler compounds </p>

<h2> Refactoring </h2>
<p> Refactoring is the process of restructuring code, while not changing its original functionality. The goal of refactoring is to improve internal code by making many small changes without altering the code's external behavior. </p>

<h2> Logical Operators </h2>
<p> A logical operator is a symbol or word used to connect two or more expressions such that the value of the compound expression produced depends only on that of the original expressions and on the meaning of the operator. Common logical operators include AND, OR, and NOT. </p>

<h2> Abstraction </h2>
<p> Abstraction is a way of generalizing details such as attributes. </p>

<h2> Branching </h2>
<p> a branch, dump or transfer is an instruction in a executing a different instruction sequence and thus deviate from its default behavior of executing instructions in order.  </p>

<h2> asynchronous and synchronous </h2>
<p> Asynchronous is a non-blocking architecture, so the execution of one task isn't dependent on another. Tasks can run simultaneously. Synchronous is a blocking architecture, so the execution of each operation depends on completing the one before it. Each task requires an answer before moving on to the next iteration. </p>
