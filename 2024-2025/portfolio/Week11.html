<h1>Encapsulation-OOP</h1>
<p>Key takeaways. In object-oriented computer programming (OOP) languages, the notion of encapsulation (or OOP Encapsulation) refers to the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit.</p>

<h1>Abstraction-OOP</h1>
<p>Abstraction in OOPS means hiding unnecessary information and displaying only necessary information. It is very important to represent real-world objects in a simplified manner for the users to interact easily.</p>

<h1>instance</h1>
<p>Instance methods are the methods that require an object of its class to be created before it can be called a class. To invoke an instance method, you have to create an object of the class in which the method is defined.</p>

<h1>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</h1>
<p>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).</p>

<h1>constructor</h1>
<p>A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes:</p>

<h1>Python self</h1>
<p>Self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self”  we can access the attributes and methods of the class in Python.</p>

<h1>JavaScript this</h1>
<p>The keyword refers to the context where a piece of code, such as a function's body, is supposed to run.</p>

<h1>imperative programming</h1>
<p>Imperative programming is a software development paradigm where Functions are implicitly coded in every step required to solve a problem. In imperative programming, every operation is coded and the code itself specifies how the problem is to be solved, which means that pre-coded models are not called on.</p>

<h1>declarative programming</h1>
<p>Declarative programming is a high-level programming concept, which is the opposite of imperative programming. It is a programming approach in which coders write code that describes what they want to do and what results they want to achieve, rather than how they will achieve the results.</p>

<h1>Array.map()</h1>
<p>The map() method of Array instances creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.</p>

<h1>Polymorphism-OOP</h1>
<p>Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows a specific routine to use variables of different types at different times. Polymorphism in programming gives a program the ability to redefine methods for derived classes.</p>

<h1>model-view-controller design pattern</h1>
<p>The MVC design pattern is a software architecture pattern that separates an application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller, making it easier to manage and maintain the codebase. It also allows for the reusability of components and promotes a more modular approach to software development.</p>

<h1> &lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt; &lt;td&gt; </h1>
<p>HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.</p>
