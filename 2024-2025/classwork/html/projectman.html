<h2> Release Phase </h2>
<p> The release phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is traditionally associated with production, deployment, and post-production activities. </p>
<h2> Plan </h2>
<p> An algorithm is a plan, a set of step-by-step instructions to resolve a problem. In an algorithm, each instruction is identified and the order in which they should be carried out is planned. Part of Computer ScienceComputational thinking. </p>
<h2> Project </h2>
<p> A project in computer science is a structured task that requires planning, coding, and problem-solving to create a software or system. It often involves writing programs, using different technologies, and testing to ensure functionality. </p>
<h2> Task list </h2>
<p> On Microsoft Windows task list shows all of the different local computer processes currently running. task list may also be used to show the processes of a remote system by using the command: task list /S "SYSTEM" . Optionally, they can be listed sorted by either the imagename, the PID or the amount of computer usage. </p>
<h2> Requirements </h2>
<p> Minimum 50% marks in Intermediate/12 years schooling/A- Level (HSSC) or Equivalent with Mathematics are required for admission in BS in Computer Science program. Equivalency certificate by IBCC will be required in case of education from some other country or system. </p>
<h2> Concept Phase </h2>
<p> During the concept phase, different solutions are developed and evaluated. Implementation plans are drawn up for the selected alternatives. To the extent that it is possible, the needs of all interest groups should be covered. In doing so, it is important to be aware of your own social conventions. </p>
<h2> inception computer </h2>
<p> An Inception Module is an image model block that aims to approximate an optimal local sparse structure in a CNN. Put simply, it allows for us to use multiple types of filter size, instead of being restricted to a single filter size, in a single image block, which we then concatenate and pass onto the next layer. </p>
<h2> Milestone </h2>
<p> Milestones in project management are used as signal posts for a project's start or end date, external reviews or input, budget checks, submission of a major deliverable, etc. A milestone is a reference point that marks a significant event or a branching decision point within a project. </p>
<h2> Unit test </h2>
<p> A unit test is a block of code that verifies the accuracy of a smaller, isolated block of application code, typically a function or method. The unit test is designed to check that the block of code runs as expected, according to the developer's theoretical logic behind it. </p>
<h2> Backlog </h2>
<p> A backlog is a list of tasks required to support a larger strategic plan. For example, a product development context contains a prioritized list of items. The product team agrees to work on these projects next. Typical items on a product backlog include user stories, changes to existing functionality, and bug fixes. </p>
<h2> Waterfall </h2>
<p> The Waterfall Model is a linear application development model that uses rigid phases: When one phase ends, the next begins. Steps occur in sequence, and, if unmodified, the model does not allow developers to go back to previous steps (hence “waterfall”: Once water falls down, it cannot go back up). </p>
